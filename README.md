# Project Creation Overview

In this project, I utilized a combination of technologies and resources to quickly set up a functional application. Here's a brief overview of the process:

## Code Integration

I incorporated a specific piece of code from the [noble-cctp GitHub repository](https://github.com/circlefin/noble-cctp/blob/4285c94ec19438ad1e05ba3e5106a5e7980cfffd/examples/depositForBurn.ts). This code is essential for handling the deposit and burn functionality for Noble Testnet and Sepolia.

## Technology Stack

For the development framework, I chose **Next.js** due to my familiarity and comfort with it. Additionally, I used **shadcn**.

## Interaction with Keplr

To interact with the Keplr extension, I relied on the documentation provided by Keplr. This allowed me to efficiently integrate wallet functionalities and ensure user interactions.

## Development Speed

Given my experience with these tools, I was able to develop the project rapidly. As a result, I did not focus extensively on the user interface, prioritizing functionality and integration instead.
