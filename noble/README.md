Build a Noble to Ethereum USDC bridge
Write a simple React app (with vite for example), styled with tailwind.

The app should be a bridge that allows users to transfer USDC from Noble to Ethereum.

The main expected features are:

Connect / disconnect his Keplr wallet
See his USDC balance on Noble
Bridge USDC from Noble to a Sepolia address
See transaction results / errors
The code quality and simplicity will be an important factor that can set you apart from other case studies.

To accomplish this you will need to use CCTP developed by Circle.

You can use circleâ€™s faucet to get testnet USDC:
